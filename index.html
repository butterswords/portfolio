# Where Butters puts some words

It's an early stage, work-in-progress portfolio and blog. It's intended to let Nathan Butters to share thoughts and code with collaborators. Some things may not be relevant to professional circles, and that's for anyone reading this to decide.

It should be updated sporadically at the start and if it proves useful then it may grow into a much larger attempt to communicate publicly. For now, feel free to enjoy what's here and provide feedback as you see fit.

Other ways to learn about Nathan Butters:

* I signed the [Data Practices Manifesto](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/) created by data.world along with the Linux Foundation Projects
* You can view my [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nathan.butters). Most of my work is covered by NDAs so it's fairly limited at the moment.
