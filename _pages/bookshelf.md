I was not always a reader. Growing up I actually loathed reading. If I could find a way to *do* something to learn, I would much rather be active than sedentary. I learned to love reading in 6th grade and for decades I read mostly fiction. Recently, as I've started to take a greater interest in finding ways to improve the world around me, rather than just survive it, I have returned to reading as a source of continual exploration and growth. I still prefer to do projects and so a lot of my reading is through audiobooks as I take my kid to school. To help me retain critical points from these books I am committing to writing my thoughts down here. This helps me capture a point-in-time reflection on the book, and perhaps start conversations with others.
