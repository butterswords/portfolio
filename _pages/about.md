Hello, my name is Nathan Butters. Feel free to call me “Nathan” or “Butters” as you see fit. Historically, ~50% of everyone I meet calls me “Butters” and I am happy to let you pick what works best for you.  

For more than ten years, I have provided companies with data-driven strategies for content, user experience, product features, and information architecture based on the needs of their customers. I use visualization to tell the stories within the data and improve how goals are created and then measured. I build more efficient, scalable processes everywhere I am because a solid process can lead to great change. Recently I find myself more focused on the creation of products to empower marketers to self-serve while adhering to centralized best practices and guidance.

This site is a place for me to showcase the work I'm doing in Data Science. The work I do for my day job is protected, so this site will focus first on projects I'm doing on my own time. If I think there are applicable lessons to share from projects I've done I will share those without referencing anything protected.

## So, who am I? [(Literally, imagine I sound like this)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOQ2JxIddzw)
Outside of work I can be found dancing/singing or telling stories to my son, Ezra, who is 3 years old; practicing Data Science, right now I'm working through the [FastAI Course](https://course.fast.ai/); coding robots, [gopigo.io](https://gopigo.io); playing board games and collaborative storytelling; golfing, as often as I possibly can; hiking; writing stories; and brewing beer. If you have an interest in any of these things feel free to connect with me and we’ll chat about them. I’m also always looking for more people to talk to about Data Science, or to play golf with. I'll take what I can get.

The rest of this section just outlines useful information to keep in mind. I don’t know that it can cover everything, and I’ll update it if you tell me there’s a section that’d be really useful.

### My personal leadership philosophy
Support one another with courage and compassion; prioritize the shared good to achieve great success.

### Quotes that speak to the core of who I am
> “Work smarter, not harder; do not balk at hard work.” - Nathan Butters [^1] 

> “True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost.” ~Arthur Ashe [^ashe]

> “Moral courage is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men.” ~George S. Patton [^patton]

> “Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts.” ~Patrick Rothfuss, Name of the Wind [^rothfuss]


[^1]: Some additional context: I am aware people misuse the first half of this phrase all the time. Sometimes you’re working as efficiently as possible. Sometimes you don't have control over your work and the only way to get the job done is to work harder. That’s why both sides of the quote are so important.
[^ashe]: Here's the [Wikipedia Article on Arthur Ashe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ashe)
[^patton]: Here's the [Wikipedia Article on Patton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton) I recognize the person as being problematic, more as I've gotten older, yet the quote remains powerful.
[^rothfuss]: Here's the [Wikipedia Article on the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Wind)
